PER-TOOL TODOs

*** fs-hasher ***

- After adding compression ratio, our CPU utilization is very high (up to 100%)
  and we cannot scan some large FSL home directories in 24 hour window.
  We should parallelize our code: producer-thread that reads data in and
  chunking/compression threads as consumer-threads.

- Chunking init methods currently set the header values for hash files.
  It is ugly. Fix it somehow.

- Add 'seed' parameter for a random chunking.

- Add PRIME and M parameters for Rabin chunking.

- Probability not in double but as integer. Definitely need, otherwise format
  mismatch.

- It would be interesting to introduce an optional pre-scan phase
  that scans all the files, counts the total amount of space occupied and
  then during the main phase outputs current progress. Say:
  N files out of M and XMB out of YMB scanned.

- Add mechanisms to detect sparse files.  Take into account special
  case of UNIX FS - NFS.

- expression support for exclude option

- collect magic numbers of the scanned files

- If someone suddenly reboots the server where fs-hasher is running,
  we don't see any warning/error message in fs-hasher's output (neither
  in stdout nor in stderr). In a large collection of hash and
  log files it is hard to identify such prematurely-terminated runs.
  I think we should have a signal handler for SIGTERM.

- use getopt_long() instead of getop() to introduce long options
  (e.g., --help).

*** hf-stat ***

- More human friendly output: order and column names

- The mode that prints only hashes

- Verify that we print all available information

- That would be great if we can support formatted output option.  E.g., we can
  use the syntax similar to blktrace: F,"format" - for files H,"format" - for
  hashes etc.

*** hashconcat ***

- refactor, as it was written in "on the knee" manner

*** hf-anonymizer ***

- We screw up the start time, the end time, and the hostname information.  This
  is because hashfilelib library sets these fields by itself. We should be able
  to override these values.

*** hf-simdex ***

- Use liblog

FORMAT TODOs

- Currently the header of a hashfile does not record the information
  about the compression method used during the scan.

- Add markers (e.g., OxDEADEAD) to detect skews while reading the hashfile.
  Or, may be checksums to ensure integrity as well?
